# Chapter 6 - CouchDB

This is the VM for chapter 6. On first boot it will provision CouchDB for you.

To boot the VM image, cd into this folder and type `vagrant up`.

When the VM is ready you can type `vagrant ssh` to connect to it. 

**Note:** There is a bug in Vagrant v1.0.4 and earlier which sometimes prevents the provisioning process from completing cleanly. If you can see `Done!` in the output then you can press Ctrl+C twice to exit the process, then type `vagrant ssh`.
